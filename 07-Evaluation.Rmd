First of all, the purpose of this chapter is to outline some of the limitations of the previously presented evaluations of mechanistic models. These evaluations answered the question: are the models of clinical value? We will show that an additional question could be: **do mechanistic models have an added clinical value?**

## Processing of biological information

Mechanistic models, and their outputs in particular, have so far been considered and evaluated as biomarkers. A comprehensive appreciation requires that they be seen as information processing tools.

### Information in, information out

Indeed, the mechanistic models presented in this thesis (Figures \@ref(fig:fey), \@ref(fig:PROFILE-METABRIC-Survival) and \@ref(fig:BRAF-results)) can be schematically represented by Figure \@ref(fig:box-mech): inputs $X$ (often omics data) are processed through a mechanistic model (here the grey box) to result in an output $Y$. These models can thus be assimilated to a mathematical transformation, often non-linear, of $X$ in $Y$. Thus, when validating the biological or clinical relevance of $Y$, either by calculating a correlation with the ground truth or by using it to stratify survival curves, only the absolute value of $Y$ is checked. This is an important step and a prerequisite for a well-constructed model. On the other hand, it is not sufficient information to understand how the model works. Indeed, the inputs $X$ probably also have a predictive or clinical value. In short, measuring only the output value of the model does not necessarily reveal the model's ability to make sense of the data it uses. At the extreme, it is conceivable that a random function of some valuable inputs could be correlated to the biological reality.

```{r box-mech, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap='(ref:box-mech-caption)', fig.scap='Evaluation of a mechanistic model', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/box-mech.png")
```
(ref:box-mech-caption) **Evaluation of a mechanistic model.** Adapted from Figure \@ref(fig:boxes).

Therefore, the question of incremental value of the model can be explained as follows: what does the output of the model represent in relation to the inputs? If we restrict ourselves to cases where the absolute biological/clinical value of $Y$ is positive, we can then identify two families of situations. We can imagine a situation where the model has improved the value of the inputs. The outputs would then have a higher value than the inputs (better biological validation etc.), or in any case a complementary value, a value not present in the inputs. This would correspond to the capture by the model of emerging or non-linar effects. In the second situation, the output does not capture emergent properties but summarizes, totally or partially, the information present in the inputs. This would correspond to a knowledge-informed dimensionality-reduction. Even in the latter case, the scientific value of the model as a tool for understanding is not necessarily questioned. The analyses presented below are simply intended to supplement the understanding of models and how they process information.

### Emergence of information in artifical examples

These questions can be illustrated using a very simple artificial model represented in Figure \@ref(fig:model-simulation). On the one hand there are two latent biological variables called *Proliferation (P)* and *Apoptosis (A)* resulting in our biological groud truth, *Growth*. On the other hand, the modeler has access to three different random variables $N_1$, $N_2$ and $N_3$ respectively associated with the sign of *P*, the absolute value of *P* and the value of *A*. Two mechanistic models are defined, one linear (with its output $O_{linear}$) and one non-linear (with its output $O_{non-linear}$). We note that the two outputs are sufficiently well defined to be correlated with *Growth* but only the non-linear model makes use of $N_2$ by multiplying it with $N_2$.

```{r model-simulation, echo=FALSE, out.width = "80%", fig.cap='(ref:box-mech-caption)', fig.scap='Definition of two distinct mechanistic models', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("fig/model-simulation.png")
```
(ref:model-simulation-caption) **Definition of two distinct mechanistic models.** Green variables are true latent phenomena. Brown variables are values accessible to the modeler ($N_i$) and the outputs extracted from the models ($O$) Statistical analysis in Figure \@ref(fig:R2-artificial).

The ability of models to use inputs to create or summarize information through outputs will be studied using the explained variation metric $R^2$. If a linear model is defined as $y_i=\beta_0+\beta_1x_i+e_i$, linear coefficients $\beta$ are estimated by minimizing the sum of squared differences between predicted and real values of $y$. The fitted model is written $\hat{y_i}=\hat{\beta_0}+\hat{\beta_1}x_i$ and $R^2$ also called coefficient of determination is defined as:

$$R^2=\dfrac{\sum_{i=1}^{n} (\hat{y_i}-\bar{y_i})^2}{\sum_{i=1}^{n}  (y_i-\bar{y_i})^2}$$

Therefore $R^2$ measures the proportion of variation in $y$ that is explained by the regressors. In order to avoid overfitting, it is possible to calculate the adjusted R2 that corrects with the number of regressors or to fit the model on training data and calculate the $R^2$ on validation data. The latter option was chosen using cross validation and averaging of the $R^2$ obtained in the different folds. Metrics with an interpretation similar to $R^2$ have been defined for logistic regressions or survival analysis [@choodari2012simulation]. In the case of regressions with several variables $x_i$, it is possible to decompose $R^2$ into different components associated with each of the variables. This decomposition is carried out here by  averaging over orderings according to the method proposed by @lindeman1980introduction and applied in R code [@gromping2006relative]. The precise formulas are detailed in appendix \@ref(appendix-decomp).  
  

Here is an example of schematic reasoning that can be carried out with $R^2$ about the two models in Figure \@ref(fig:model-simulation). Using only the outputs of the models to predict *Growth*, explained variations are $R^2_{O_{non-linear}}=0.455$ and $R^2_{O_{linear}}=0.379$. The models are thus correctly defined and partly recover the biological read-out. However, the inputs to the model also have an important predictive value since $R^2_{N_1+N_2+N_3}=0.514$. How can we understand the relationship between these values? First, the model including the $N_i$ inputs and the output $O$ as regressors show different performances with $R^2_{N_1+N_2+N_3+O_{linear}}=0.514$ and $R^2_{N_1+N_2+N_3+O_{non-linear}}=0.586$. This means that the $O_{linear}$ has no added value compared to the inputs. This was expected given its definition. On the other hand, $O_{non-linear}$ has allowed to extract an emergent information which improves the global prediction when combined with the inputs. We can go further in understanding by breaking down the $R^2$. In Figure \@ref(fig:R2-artificial)A and B (left columns), $R^2$ of the inputs' models are decomposed to show that $N_1$ and $N_3$ contribute most to the prediction in a linear model. By using the same strategies for decomposing the $R_2$ and calculating the incremental R2, it is also possible to decompose the $R^2$ of $O$ according to its origin: its component $N_1$ ($0.22$ in Figure \@ref(fig:R2-artificial)A) is the proportion of $R^2$ that is also explained by $N_1$, so it can be interpreted as being the part of the value of $N_1$ captured by $O$. In the non-linear case, we can see in the decomposition that $O$ also has a created component ($0.07$), it is the non-linear component that is not shared with any of the inputs.

In conclusion, if these two models generate meaningful outputs that are correlated with the biological read-out *Growth*, the analysis of their information processing classifies them into two different categories outlined in the previous sub-section. The linear model summarizes some of the information present in the inputs, without creating any. It can be likened to a relevant dimensionality reduction. The output of the non-linear model also fails to avoid some information losses, but at the same time it extracts new non-linear information. Thus, in combination with the inputs, it provides added value measured by the increase in total $R^2$. Note that $R^2$ is used here as one tool among others to illustrate the reflection on models as information processing tools. The point to remember is not technical but rather methodological: these mechanistic models based on omics data cannot be evaluated for themselves but must be evaluated in comparison with the data they use in order to better explain the way they process information. In this logic of model selection, other tools such as the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) have been proposed and could allow to quantify if the reduction of dimension carried out by the models (from many omics inputs to one mechanistic output) allows a more parsimonious description of biology than the direct use of inputs [@kirk2013model]. 

## Reanalysis of mechanistic models of cancer

Using the tools presented above, it is possible to deepen the analysis of some mechanistic models already presented in this thesis.

### ODE model of JNK pathway by @fey2015signaling

One of the first applications of personalized mechanistic models to cancer is the one proposed by @fey2015signaling regarding JNK pathways in patients with neuroblastomas. This work has been described in section \@ref(prognostic) and is recalled in Figure \@ref(fig:fey2). The evaluation of the mechanistic models in the original paper was performed by assessing the clinical value of the inputs (RNA levels of ZAK, MKK4, MKK7, JNK and AKT genes) and outputs ($H$, $A$ and $K_{50}$) separately by comparing them with survival data. The outputs were binarized to optimize the separation between the curves in a log-rank test. In this section we propose to quantify the value of the output in relation to those of the inputs, leaving the output continuous, using the tools described in the previous section. In the context of survival data, the $R^2$ described above is replaced by the $R^2$ defined by @royston2004new, whose properties have been validated using simulated data [@choodari2012simulation].

```
(ref:fey2-caption) **Mechanistic modeling of JNK pathway and survival of neuroblastima patients, as described by @fey2015signaling.** (A) Schematic representation, as a process description, for the ODE model of JNK pathway. (B) Response curve (phosphorylated JNK) as a function of the input stimulus (Stress) and characterization of the corresponding sigmoidal function with maximal amplitude $A$, Hill exponent $H$ and activation threshold $K_{50}$. (C) Survival curves for neuroblastoma patients based on binarized $A$, $K_{50}$ and $H$; binarization thresholds having been defined based on optimization screening on calibration cohort.  
  

Thus the $R^2$ of the output $H$ is $0.39$ while that of the combined inputs is $0.60$. We can see from the decompositions that $H$ derives most of its the value from ZAK, MKK4 and AKT (Figure \@ref(fig:R2-Fey)A, left column), which were already the largest contributors in the combined evaluation of the inputs (Figure \@ref(fig:R2-Fey)A, right column). However, $H$ also includes an emerging non-linear share ($R^2=0.08$) that was not explained by the linear combination of inputs. Thus, combining $H$ with the inputs in a survival prediction model does indeed allow to observe an added value with a global $R^2$ of $0.08$. In addition, the authors in the original study stressed the importance of positive feedback from JNK to MKK7 (Figure \@ref(fig:fey2)A). In its absence, we find that the value of H is almost reduced to zero, since not only its non-linear part (Figure \@ref(fig:R2-Fey), red share), but also its parts derived from inputs, disappear. Analyzing the other outputs of the model ($A$ and $K_{50}$) reveals similar but less dramatic trends underlining the importance of this feedback which allows the model to capture a clinically relevant behaviour, assimilated by the authors to the capacity of cells to trigger apoptosis in case of stress. In the case of this model, the analyses provide a better understanding of how the model works with respect to survival prediction: the outputs partly summarize clinical information already present in the inputs but also reveal relevant emerging information.

### Personalized logical models: BRAF inhibition in melanoma and colorectal cancers

Similarly, it is appropriate to assess the relevance of the personalized logical models presented so far. Unlike the models of the previous sub-section, however, they integrate a much larger number of variables and the decomposition of $R^2$ is no longer accessible, because of its computational cost, which increases exponentially with the number of variables. If we focus on the example best suited to these models, that of BRAF inhibition sensistivity, we can however reformulate the question more simply. Given that the most important predictor of the answer is the status of the BRAF mutation itself, do the personalized models allow us to do better or provide additional information? In the case of the CRISPR data, the $R^2$ of BRAF alone is $0.75$, whereas the $R^2$ of the personalized scores from the models is $0.73$, while the combination of the two increases the $R^2$ to $0.83$. In the absence of a precise decomposition, this gain can come either from the contribution of the other variables used in the model (the RNA levels of CRAF for example) or from the evidence of non-linear effects. In both cases, these figures are another way of expressing the remarks in section \@ref(diff-BRAF): thanks to the integration of other data and their organization in a framework based on literature knowledge, the model provides a more precise and complete vision of the response mechanisms. As positive as it is, this increase in $R^2$ remains modest, illustrating that the main interest of these models is not necessarily a pure gain in predictive performance. Rather, it lies in their explanatory capacity and in their ability to support the investigation of mechanisms such as in section \@ref(diff-BRAF). In a complementary way, one could imagine extending these analyses to other nodes of the model and not only to its output in order to dissect even more precisely the information processing within the model.
