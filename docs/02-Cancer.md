# Cancer as deregulation of complex machinery

\epigraph{"All happy families are alike; each unhappy family is unhappy in its own way."}{Leo Tolstoy (Anna Karenina, 1877)}



\initial{A}rmed with all these models, whether statistical or mechanistic, we are going to look at a particularly complex system that fully justifies their use: cancer. Since the first chapter recalled how important prior knowledge of the phenomenon under study is for designing models, whatever their nature, this chapter will briefly summarize some of the most important characteristics of this disease before returning to the models themselves in the next chapter. Without aiming for exhaustiveness, and after an epidemiological and statistical description, we will focus on the most useful information for the modeller, i.e. the underlying biological mechanisms and available data.

## What is cancer?

Cancer can be described as a group of diseases characterized by uncontrolled cell divisions and growth which can spread to surrounding tissues. Descriptions of this disease, and essentially associated solid tumours, have been found as far back as ancient Egyptian documents, at least 1600 BC and we know from the first century A.D. with Aulus Celsus that it is better to remove the tumors and this as soon as possible [@hajdu2011note]. Progress will accelerate during the Renaissance with the renewed interest in medicine, and anatomy in particular, which will advance the knowledge of tumour pathology and surgery [@hajdu2011note2]. The progress of anatomical knowledge has also left brilliant testimonies in the field of painting, which make the renown of the Renaissance today. The precision of these artists' traits has also allowed some retrospective medical analyses, some of them going so far as to identify the signs of a tumour in certain subjects [@bianucci2018earliest]. Such is the bluish stain on the left breast of the Bathsheba painted by Rembrandt (Figure \@ref(fig:bath)) which has been subject to controversial interpretations, sometimes described as an example of "skin discolouration, distortion of symmetry with axillary fullness and peau d'orange" [@braithwaite1983rembrandt] and sometimes spared by photonic and computationnal analyses [@heijblom2014monte]. The mechanisms of the disease only began to be elucidated with the appearance of the microscope in the 19th century, which revealed its cellular origin [@hajdu2012note].
