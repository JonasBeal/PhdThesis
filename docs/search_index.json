Ce qui ne l’est pas est inutilisable.” Paul Valéry (Mauvaises pensées et autres, 1942) The notion of modeling is embedded in science, to the point that it has sometimes been used to define the very nature of scientific research. What is called a model can, however, correspond to very different realities which need to be defined before addressing the object of this thesis which will consist, if one wants to be mischievous, in analyzing models with other models. This semantic elucidation is all the more necessary as this thesis is interdisciplinary, suspended between systems biology and biostatistics. In order to convince the reader of the need for such a preamble, he is invited to ask a statistician and a biologist how they would define what a model is. Figure 1.1: A scientist and his model. Joseph Wright of Derby, A Philosopher Giving a Lecture at the Orrery (in which a lamp is put in place of the sun), c. 1763-65, oil on canvas, Derby Museums and Art Gallery 1.1 What is a model? A model is first of all an ambiguous object and a polysemous word.Among the many meanings proposed by the dictionary ??, several even find echoes in scientific practice. It is sometimes a question of the physical representation of an object, often on a reduced scale, and sometimes of a theoretical description intended to facilitate the understanding of the way in which a system works, or even sometimes an ideal to achieve (Collins 2020).

Not required to be right but should be valid (depends on the objective). May be able to predict or at least to test. Pubmed tree Material/physical models (from orrery to drosophila) Formal/theoretical models “No substantial part of the universe is so simple that it can be grasped and controlled without abstraction. Abstraction consists in replacing the part of the universe under consideration by a model of similar but simpler structure. Models, formal and intellectual on the one hand, or material on the other, are thus a central necessity of scientific procedure.” https://www.nemenmanlab.org/~ilya/images/9/99/Rosenblueth-wiener-1945.pdf Philosophy (Frigg and Hartmann 2020) Galilean idealization with reality distortion But even toy models for salient features Historically physical models Then mathematics as a language Statistical models with a priori knowledge In vivo, in vitro, in silico, 1.2 Statistical modeling Within formal models -&gt; 2 kinds (Baker et al. 2018) https://gosilico.com/technology/mechanistic-vs-statistical-models/ 1.3 Mechanistic modeling "],
