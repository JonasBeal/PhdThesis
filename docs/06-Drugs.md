This chapter extends the method presented in the previous chapter to investigate drug response with personalized logical models. The first application to cell lines of all cancer types was presented orally at ISMB2020 in Basel but is not published. The example concerning BRAF in melanomas and colorectal cancers is under revision and the corresponding pre-print is available as @beal2020personalized. Finally, the work on prostate cancer presented in a third section has also been submitted.
