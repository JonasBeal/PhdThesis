\epigraph{"Ce qui est simple est toujours faux. Ce qui ne l'est pas est inutilisable."}{Paul Valéry (Mauvaises pensées et autres, 1942)}

\initial{T}he notion of modeling is embedded in science, to the point
that it has sometimes been used to define the very nature of scientific
research. What is called a model can, however, correspond to very
different realities which need to be defined before addressing the
object of this thesis which will consist, if one wants to be
mischievous, in analyzing models with other models. This semantic
elucidation is all the more necessary as this thesis is
interdisciplinary, suspended between systems biology and biostatistics.
In order to convince the reader of the need for such a preamble, he is
invited to ask a statistician and a systems biologist the question how
they would define what a model is.

\section{What is a model?}\label{what-is-a-model}

\subsection{In your own words}\label{in-your-own-words}

A model is first of all an ambiguous object and a polysemous word. It
therefore seems necessary to start with a semantic study. Among the many
meanings and synonymous proposed by the dictionary (Figure
\ref{fig:visual-thesaurus}), while some definitions are more related to
art, several find echoes in scientific practice. It is sometimes a
question of the physical representation of an object, often on a reduced
scale as in Figure \ref{fig:orrery}, and sometimes of a theoretical
description intended to facilitate the understanding of the way in which
a system works \citep{dictionnarymodel}. It is even sometimes an ideal
to be reached and therefore an ambitious prospect for an introduction.

\begin{figure}[ht]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{fig/visualThesaurus} 

}

\caption[Network visualization of *model* thesaurus entries]{\textbf{Network visualization of
\emph{model} thesaurus entries.} Generated with the
\href{https://www.visualthesaurus.com}{`Visual Thesaurus'} ressource}\label{fig:visual-thesaurus}
\end{figure}





The narrower perspective of the scientist does not reduce the
completeness of the dictionary's description to an unambiguous object
\citep{bailer2002scientists}. In an attempt to approach these
mult-faceted objects that are the models, Daniela Bailer-Jones
interviewed different scientists and asked them the same question: what
is a model? Across the different profiles and fields of study, the
answers vary but some patterns begin to emerge (Figure
\ref{fig:interviews}). A model must capture the essence of the
phenomenon being studied. Because it eludes, voluntarily or not, many
details or complexity, it is by nature a simplification of the
phenomenon. These limitations may restrict its validity to certain cases
or suspend it to the fulfilment of some hypotheses. They are not
necessarily predictive, but they must be able to generate new
hypotheses, be tested and possibly questioned. Finally, and
fundamentally, they must provide insights about the object of study and
contribute to its understanding.

\begin{figure}[ht]

\caption[Scientists talk about their models: words cloud.]{\textbf{Scientists talk about their models:
words cloud.} Cloud of words summarizing the lexical fields used by
scientists to talk about their models in dedicated interviews
\citep{bailer2002scientists}.}\label{fig:interviews}
\end{figure}






These definitions circumscribe the \emph{model} object, its use and its
objectives, but they do not in any way describe its nature. And for good
reason, because even if we agree on the described contours, the
biodiversity of the models remains overwhelming for taxonomists:

\begin{quote}
\emph{Probing models, phenomenological models, computational models,
developmental models, explanatory models, impoverished models, testing
models, idealized models, theoretical models, scale models, heuristic
models, caricature models, exploratory models, didactic models, fantasy
models, minimal models, toy models, imaginary models, mathematical
models, mechanistic models, substitute models, iconic models, formal
models, analogue models, and instrumental models are but some of the
notions that are used to categorize models.} \citep{frigg2020models}
\end{quote}

\subsection{Physical world and world of
ideas}\label{physical-world-and-world-of-ideas}

Without claiming to be exhaustive, we can make a first simple dichotomy
between physical/material and formal/intellectual models
\citep{rosenblueth1945role}. The former consist in replacing the object
of study by another object, just as physical but nevertheless simpler or
better known. These may be models involving a change of scale such as
the simple miniature replica placed in a wind tunnel, or the metal
double helix model used by Watson and Crick to visualize DNA. In all
these cases the model allows to visualize the object of study (Figure
\ref{fig:planets} A and B) to manipulate it and play with it to better
understand or explain, just like the scientist with his orrery (Figure
\ref{fig:orrery}). In the case of biology, we will think mainly of model
organisms such as drosophila, zebrafish or mice, for example. We then
benefit from the relative simplicity of their genomes, a shorter time
scale or ethical differences, usually to elucidate mechanisms of
interest in humans. Correspondence between the target system and its
model can sometimes be more conceptual, such as that ones relying on
mechanical--electrical analogies: a mechanical system (e.g.~a
spring-mass system) can sometimes be represented by an electric network
(e.g.~a RLC circuit).

\begin{figure}[ht]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{01-Models_files/figure-latex/planets-1} 

}

\caption[Orrery, planets and models]{\textbf{Orrery, planets and models}. Physical
models of planetary motion, either geocentric (Armillary sphere from
\emph{Plate LXXVII} in
\href{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:EB1711_Armillary_Sphere.png}{\emph{Encyclopedia
Britannica}}, 1771) or heliocentric in panel B (Bion, 1751,
\href{https://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b2600252q/f8.item.r=Bion}{catalogue
Bnf}) and some geometric representations by Johannes Kepler in panel C
(in
\href{https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Kepler_astronomia_nova.jpg}{\emph{Astronomia
Nova}}, 1609)}\label{fig:planets}
\end{figure}












The model is then no longer simply a mimetic replica but is based on an
intellectual equivalence: we are gradually moving into the realm of
formal models \citep{rosenblueth1945role}. These are of a more symbolic
nature and they represent the original system with a set of logical or
mathematical terms, describing the main driving forces or similar
structural properties as geometrical models of planetary motions
summarized by Kepler in Figure \ref{fig:planets}C. Historically these
models have often been expressed by sets of mathematical equations or
relationships. Increasingly, these have been implemented by computer.
Despite their sometimes less analytical and more numerical nature, many
so-called computational models could also belong to this category of
formal models. There are then many formalisms, discrete or continuous,
deterministic or stochastic, based on differential equations or Boolean
algebra \citep{fowler1997mathematical}. Despite their more abstract
nature, they offer similar scientific services: it is possible to play
with their parameters, specifications or boundary conditions in order to
better understand the phenomenon. One can also imagine these formal
models from a different perspective, which starts from the data in a
bottom-up approach instead of starting from the phenomenon in a top-down
analysis. These models will then often be called statistical models or
models of data\citep{frigg2020models}. This distinction will be further
clarified in section \ref{stat-mech}.

To summarize and continue a little longer with the astronomical
metaphor, the study of a particularly complex system (the solar system)
can be broken down into a variety of different models. Physical and
mechanical models such as armillary spheres (\ref{fig:planets}A and B),
which make it possible to touch the object of study. Moreover, we can
observe the evolution of models which, when confronted with data, have
progressed from a geocentric to a heliocentric representation to get
closer to the current state of knowledge. Sometimes, models with more
formal representations are used to give substance to ideas and
hypotheses (\ref{fig:planets}C). One of the most conceptual forms is
then the mathematical language and one can thus consider that the
different models find their culmination in Kepler's equations about
orbits, areas and periods that describe the elliptical motion of the
planets. We refer to them today as Kepler's laws. The model has become a
law and therefore a paragon of mathematical modeling
\citep{wan2018mathematical}.

\subsection{Preview about cancer
models}\label{preview-about-cancer-models}

As we get closer to the subject of our study, and in order to illustrate
these definitions more concretely, we can take an interest in the
meaning of the word \emph{model} in the context of cancer research. For
this, we restrict our corpus to articles responding to the ``cancer
model'' search in the Pubmed article database. Among these, we look at
the occurrences of the word \emph{model} and the sentences in which it
is included. This cancer-related context of model is represented as a
tree in Figure \ref{fig:pubmed-tree}. Some of the distinctions already
mentioned can be found here. The \emph{mouse} and \emph{xenograft}
models, which will be discussed later in this thesis, represent some of
the most common physical models in cancer studies. These are animal
models in which the occurrence and mechanisms of cancer, usually induced
by the experimenter, are studied. On the other hand, \emph{prediction},
\emph{prognostic} or \emph{risk score} models refer to formal models and
borrow from statistical language.

\begin{figure}[ht]

{\centering \includegraphics[width=0.9\linewidth]{fig/pubmed-tree} 

}

\caption[Tree visualization of *model* semantic context in cancer-related literature]{\textbf{Tree visualization of \emph{model}

\href{https://esperr.github.io/pub-trees/}{`PubTrees'} tool by Ed Sperr,
and based on most relevant PubMed entries for ``cancer model'' search.}\label{fig:pubmed-tree}
\end{figure}






Another way to classify cancer models may be to group them into the
following categories: \emph{in vivo}, \emph{in vitro} and \emph{in
silico}. The first two clearly belong to the physical models but one
uses whole living organisms (a human tumour implanted in an
immunodeficient mouse) and the other separates the living from its
organism in order to place it in a controlled environment (tumour cells
in growth medium in a Petri dish). \textbf{In the thesis, data from both
\emph{in vivo} and \emph{in vitro} models will be used. However, unless
otherwise stated, a model will always refer to a representation \emph{in
silico}.} This third category, however, contains a very wide variety of
models \citep{deisboeck2009silico}, to which we will come back in
chapter @ref(computational\_cancer). A final ambiguity about the nature
of the formal models used in this thesis needs to be clarified
beforehand.

\section{Simplicity is the ultimate
sophistication}\label{simplicity-is-the-ultimate-sophistication}

To conclude this modeling introduction, it is important to highlight one
of the most important points already introduced in a concise manner by
Valéry at the beginning of this chapter. Whatever its nature, a model is
a simplified representation of reality and by extension is always wrong
to a certain extent. This is a generally well-accepted fact, but it is
crucial to understand the implications for the modeller. This
simplification is not a collateral effect but an intrinsic feature of
any model:

\begin{quote}
\emph{No substantial part of the universe is so simple that it can be
grasped and controlled without abstraction. Abstraction consists in
replacing the part of the universe under consideration by a model of
similar but simpler structure. Models, formal and intellectual on the
one hand, or material on the other, are thus a central necessity of
scientific procedure.} \citep{rosenblueth1945role}
\end{quote}

Therefore, a model exists only because we are not able to deal directly
with the phenomenon and simplification is a necessity to make it more
tractable \citep{potochnik2017idealization}. This simplification
appeared many times in the studies of frictionless planes or
theoretically isolated systems, in a totally deliberate strategy.
However, this idealization can be viewed in several ways
{[}weisberg2007three{]}. One of them, called Aristotelian or minimal
idealization, is to eliminate all the properties of an object that we
think are not relevant to the problem in question. This amounts to lying
by omission or making assumptions of insignificance by focusing on key
causal factors only \citep{frigg2020models}. We therefore refer to the
\emph{a priori} idea that we have of the phenomenon. The other
idealization, called Galilean, is to deliberately distort the theory to
make it tractable as explicited by Galileo himself:

\begin{quote}
\emph{We are trying to investigate what would happen to moveables very
diverse in weight, in a medium quite devoid of resistance, so that the
whole difference of speed existing between these moveables would have to
be referred to inequality of weight alone. \ldots{} Since we lack such a
space, let us (instead) observe what happens in the thinnest and least
resistant media, comparing this with what happens in others less thin
and more resistant.}

This fairly pragmatic approach should make it possible to evolve
iteratively, reducing distortions as and when possible. We will have the
opportunity to come back to the idealizations made in the course of the
cancer models but it is already possible to give some orientations. The
experimenter who seeks to study cancer using cell lines or animal models
is clearly part of Galileo's lineage. The mathematical or \emph{in
silico} modeler has a more balanced profile. The design of qualitative
mechanistic models based on prior knowledge, which is the core of the
second part of the thesis, is more akin to minimal idealization, which
seeks to highlight the salient features of a system. This pragmatism
consisting in creating computationnaly-tractable models is also quite
widespread, particularly in highly dimensional statistical approaches.

Because of the complexity of the phenomena, simplification is therefore
a necessity. The objective then should not necessarily be to make the
model more complex, but to match its level of simplification with its
assumptions and objectives. Faced with the temptation of the author of
the model, or his reviewer, to always extend and complicate the model,
it could be replied with Lewis Carrol words\footnote{More concisely, in
  \citep{rosenblueth1945role}, ``best material model for a cat is
  another cat, or preferably the same cat.''}:

\begin{quote}
\emph{``That's another thing we've learned from your Nation,'' said Mein
Herr, ``map-making. But we've carried it much further than you. What do
you consider the largest map that would be really useful?'' ``About six
inches to the mile.'' ``Only six inches!'' exclaimed Mein Herr. ``We
very soon got to six yards to the mile. Then we tried a hundred yards to
the mile. And then came the grandest idea of all! We actually made a map
of the country, on the scale of a mile to the mile!'' ``Have you used it
much?'' I enquired. ``It has never been spread out, yet,'' said Mein
Herr: ``the farmers objected: they said it would cover the whole
country, and shut out the sunlight! So we now use the country itself, as
its own map, and I assure you it does nearly as well.'' Lewis Carroll,
