# Computational modeling of cancer: from complex disease to systems biology

\epigraph{"How remarkable is life? The answer is: very. Those of us who deal in networks of chemical reactions know of nothing like it... How could a chemical sludge become a rose, even with billions of years to try."}{George Whitesides}

Different kinds of models: scales --> focus to signaling. We will model a cell

Many reviews
Timeline of mathematics and cancer [@byrne2010dissecting]. Mainly focused on angiogenesis, carconigenesis and tumour growth. Different formalisms depending on scales review [@bellomo2008foundations]. Focus on cellular scale and bigger.

Integrative and scales. Many mathematical models are cell-based [@anderson2008integrative]

PKPD and regimens [@barbolosi2016computational]

Tumour growth [@benzekry2014classical]

## Features of complex systems: emergence, non-linearity, feedback

critical transitions in multiple fields [@trefois2015critical]
bistable and switches [@markevich2004signaling]

Cancer systems biology can be understood as the study of how perturbations of
the normal and healthy genome leads to tumorigenesis. This interdisciplinary fields
combine mathematics, statistics, physics, and molecular biology in order to decipher
or to begin to understand the effect of these alterations [16].
The cell can be seen as a system composed of genes, proteins, small molecules,
enzymes, etc. which interact and are involved in many different intertwined signalling
pathways. Cancer is characterised by an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic
alterations and regulatory networks, which deregulate the molecular machinery
of normal cells. Cancer is often referred to as a network disease [1], because the
genes that are mutated or altered affect or even rewire the original network leading
to different outcomes [17]. An alteration of one of these genes may have an impact
or not on the cellular fate; the outcome is often unpredictable and unexpected.
