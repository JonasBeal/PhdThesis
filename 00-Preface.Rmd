\chapter*{Preface}

\initial{T}he present thesis is structured in three parts, each subdivided into three chapters. Since the whole thesis is about cancer modeling, the first part aims at defining the type of model to be referred to, and in particular models that will be called mechanistic, as well as the object of the modeling, i.e. the molecular networks involved in cancer. So the first part answers the question: **what is a cancer model and what is its purpose?**  
  

The second part will be devoted to the methods developed during this thesis to transform qualitative models of molecular networks, known as logic models, into personalized models that can be interpreted clinically. In short, **how can a mathematical representation of biological knowledge be transformed into a tool that contributes to the understanding of the clinical manifestations of cancer?**  
  

Finally, the third and last part will look at how the clinical relevance of all the above-mentioned models can be rigorously evaluated, both in their ability to predict the evolution of the disease and in their ability to recommend the most appropriate treatments for each patient. **How to quantify and interpret the value of the clinical information delivered by these models?**  
  

Moreover, this thesis also exists in an online version that allows to take advantage of the interactivity of some graphs and applications: \url{https://jonasbeal.github.io/thesis/}.
