Different kinds of models: scales --> focus to signaling. We will model a cell

Cancer systems biology can be understood as the study of how perturbations of
the normal and healthy genome leads to tumorigenesis. This interdisciplinary fields
combine mathematics, statistics, physics, and molecular biology in order to decipher
or to begin to understand the effect of these alterations [16].
The cell can be seen as a system composed of genes, proteins, small molecules,
enzymes, etc. which interact and are involved in many different intertwined signalling
pathways. Cancer is characterised by an accumulation of genetic and epigenetic
alterations and regulatory networks, which deregulate the molecular machinery
of normal cells. Cancer is often referred to as a network disease [1], because the
genes that are mutated or altered affect or even rewire the original network leading
to different outcomes [17]. An alteration of one of these genes may have an impact
or not on the cellular fate; the outcome is often unpredictable and unexpected.
