## What is a model?

<!-- Generic intro -->
A model is first of all an ambiguous object and a polysemous word. It therefore seems necessary to start with a semantic study. Among the many meanings and synonymous proposed by the dictionary \@ref(fig:visual-thesaurus), while some definitions are more related to art, several find echoes in scientific practice. It is sometimes a question of the physical representation of an object, often on a reduced scale \@ref(fig:orrery), and sometimes of a theoretical description intended to facilitate the understanding of the way in which a system works [@dictionnarymodel]. It is even sometimes an ideal to be reached and therefore an ambitious prospect for an introduction.

<!-- For scientists -->

The narrower perspective of the scientist does not reduce the completeness of the dictionary's description to an unambiguous object [@bailer2002scientists]. In an attempt to approach these mult-faceted objects that are the models, Daniela Bailer-Jones interviewed different scientists and asked them the same question: what is a model? Across the different profiles and fields of study, the answers vary but different patterns begin to emerge. A model must capture the essence of the phenomenon being studied. Because it eludes, voluntarily or not, many details or complexity, it is by nature a simplification of the phenomenon. These limitations may restrict its validity to certain cases or suspend it to the fulfilment of some hypotheses. They are not necessarily predictive, but they must be able to generate new hypotheses, be tested and possibly questioned. Finally, and fundamentally, they must provide insights about the object of study and contribute to its understanding.

Material/physical models (from orrery to drosophila)
Formal/theoretical models


"No substantial part of the universe is so simple that it can be grasped and controlled without abstraction. Abstraction consists in replacing the part of the universe under consideration by a model of similar but simpler structure. Models, formal and intellectual on the one hand, or material on the other, are thus a central necessity of scientific procedure."
